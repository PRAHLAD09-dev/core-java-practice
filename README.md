# Core Java Practice
 This repository contains my Core Java   practice code covering fundamental OOP  concepts with clear, real-world examples.
 
 # Encapsulation
-Private data members
-Constructor initialization
-Getters for controlled access
-toString() override
-Real-world example: BankAccount
- Folder: encapsulation/

 # Inheritance
-Parent–child relationship
-Code reuse using extends
-Real-world example: Vehicle → Car / Bike
-Folder: inheritance/

# Polymorphism
- Runtime polymorphism using method overriding
- Parent reference holding child object
- Same method call, different behavior at runtime
- Real-world example: Payment system (UPI / Credit Card / Net Banking)
- Folder: polymorphism/

## Upcoming Topics
-Abstraction
-Interfaces
-Loose Coupling
-Exception Handling
-Collections Framework
-Multithreading
-Stream API

## Tech Stack
- Java
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
  
## Structure
- Each folder represents a single Core Java / OOP concept
- Concepts are implemented independently for better clarity
- Examples are simple, readable, and focused on learning
- Emphasis on core Java fundamentals and real-world logic

## Purpose
 This repository is created to strengthen my Core Java and OOP fundamentals through hands-on practice  and real-world examples.

 This repository will be continuously updated as I progress further in Core Java.
